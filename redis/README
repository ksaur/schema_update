Download redis...I grabbed redis-2.8.17.

More changes to be added soon.  For now, just dump the generated C file (save
it as jsondiffcmds.c) into redis' /src directory, and change the Makefile in
/src to the one here.

(The only changes to Redis' make file are the linking with jansson and the
compiling the jsondiffcmds.o file)
