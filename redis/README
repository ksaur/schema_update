Download redis...I grabbed redis-2.8.17.

More changes to be added soon.  For now, just dump the generated C file (save
it as jsondiffcmds.c) into redis' /src directory, and change the Makefile in
/src to the one here.

(The only changes to Redis' make file are the linking with jansson and the
compiling the jsondiffcmds.o file)

Later, this (jsondiffcmds.o) is going to have to be some sort of dynamically
loaded object so that the user can dynamically generated and then run what
schema change they want...
