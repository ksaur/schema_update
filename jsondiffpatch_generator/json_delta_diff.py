def compute_keysets(left_seq, right_seq):
    '''Compare the keys of ``left_seq`` vs. ``right_seq``.

    Determines which keys ``left_seq`` and ``right_seq`` have in
    common, and which are unique to each of the structures.  Arguments
    should be instances of the same basic type, which must be a
    non-terminal: i.e. list or dict.  If they are lists, the keys
    compared will be integer indices.

    Returns:
        Return value is a 3-tuple of sets ``({overlap}, {left_only},
        {right_only})``.  As their names suggest, ``overlap`` is a set
        of keys ``left_seq`` have in common, ``left_only`` represents
        keys only found in ``left_seq``, and ``right_only`` holds keys
        only found in ``right_seq``.

    Raises:
        AssertionError if ``left_seq`` is not an instance of
        ``type(right_seq)``, or if they are not of a non-terminal
        type.
