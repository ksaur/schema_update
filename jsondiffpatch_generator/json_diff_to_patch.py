    Determines which keys ``left_seq`` and ``right_seq`` have in

    should be instances of the same basic type, which must be a
    non-terminal: i.e. list or dict.  If they are lists, the keys

    Returns:
        Return value is a 3-tuple of sets ``({overlap}, {left_only},
        {right_only})``.  As their names suggest, ``overlap`` is a set
        of keys ``left_seq`` have in common, ``left_only`` represents
